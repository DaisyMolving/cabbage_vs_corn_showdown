** WELCOME TO THE CABBAGE VS CORN SHOWDOWN **

This game is the same as tic-tac-toe, or noughts and crosses, and is made for two players.

First you and a friend must decide who would like to be cabbage and who would like to be corn. Cabbage will have the first turn, but this is not necessarily be an advantage!

When you click on a box you will claim it with an icon that matches your corn or cabbage character.

The aim of the game is to have three of your icons in a row, but be careful that your opponent doesn't make it first! Pay attention to where they are moving, and block them by anticipating their next move and putting your icon in the way!

You can only put your icon in an empty space.

If no-one wins, do not fret! You can select to play again in the dialog box that will appear, and the game will re-set.

Have fun!
